3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below: 

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material? 
Youtube, Chatgpt, W3Schools
2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
I will do the tutorials through W3schools
3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
C++ file.
4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday after 5pm, in STC building or at home.
5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
It will be hard just because it is first time for me to use C++. So it is my skill issue.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 05/02    | 21:00    |  IM    | I completed to study the W3SChools Tutorial|   2hours    |
| 05/04    | 20:00    |  IM    | I studid C++ functions and Classes in W3Schools|   3hours    |
| 05/05    | 20:30    |  IM    | I wrote codes for two methods to function to check if the letter that user guessed is in the answer words and display the letter if there is the letter                                   |   2.5 hours |
| 05/06    | 19:30    |  IM    | I wrote the main code for hangman game     |   2.5 hours |
| 05/08    | 20:00    |  TP    | I tried to make html file in our github so that all our team get into that file and edit it                                                                          |   2 hour    |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/jjm981111/CSE-310/blob/main/source/repos/hangman/hangman/hangman.cpp

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here:

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |  Yes   |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|  Yes   |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |  Yes   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |  Yes   |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |  Yes   |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge. No Stretch Challenge

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it. No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|      10 hours     |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint. The hardest part was setting the initial environment of C++. I took so much time to figure out how to set compiler and path since it is first time for me to deal with C++. Eventually, I just downloaded Visual Studio(not VS Code) and I could run my code.
