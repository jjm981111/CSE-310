## Overview

**Project Title**: Hangman Game

**Project Description**: Writing the code for Hangman Game using C++.

**Project Goals**: Making the game work when I run it.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Set up the initial environment of C++
2. Complete the tutorial of C++ in W3School so that I can learn how to use classes and functions in C++.
3. Writing the Code

Instructions for using the software:

1. Download Visual Studio.
2. Click the run button.
3. After the screen shows up, you can play the game.(I think pretty much everyone may know how to play hangmangame.)

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* I first tried to write the code in VS code, but it is a lot simpler to do it in Visual Studio. Because, you don't have to set compilers and paths in Visual Studio. So I strongly recommand Visual Studio if you want to use C++.
