## Overview

**Project Title**: Guess the number game

**Project Description**: Writing the code for guessing number game using Java

**Project Goals**: Making the game work when I run it.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the visual studio.
2. Download the Java and JDK to run and debug the program
3. Download the Java extention tools.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Click on the run button
2. The game will start on the terminal, so you can type the number you guess.
3. You can guess until you guess right or attempts are 0.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* One thing that disturbed me is to figure out how to set up Java. In order to run and debug the Java program, you need to download JDK and set up the path. Also, if I knew the basic knowledge of object-oriented programming language, it would be helpful.
