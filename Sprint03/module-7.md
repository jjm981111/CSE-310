3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, or HashMap)

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
Youtube, Chatgpt, W3Schools

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

I will do the tutorials through W3schools

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
Java file

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday after 5pm, in STC building or at home.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
It will be hard just because it is first time for me to use Java. So it is my skill issue.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  05/30   |   21:00  |   IM   |         Setting up the Java and going through W3school Java tutorial. I had to download Java tool such as JDK, and I had to set up the path too to run and debug the Java program.         |    4 hours  |
|  05/31   |   20:00  |   IM   |  Started to make the guessnumber class. Added the code for random number genrator and how many attempts are given to the user. Alos, added the space where the user can type their input.     |    3 hours  |
|  06/02   |   20:00  |   IM   |   Code for loop part. Using while loop, I made the code that keeps asking the question for what the number is until the user guess the right number or until the remaining attempts are 0. Also, added the output messages of the game. |   3 hours   |
|  06/03   |   21:00  |   TP   |   Helped with the web scraping             |    2 hours  |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |
|          |          |        |                                            |             |

_Note: Add more rows as needed._

No Stretch Challenge

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
I didn't change it.

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint. 
It wasn't super complicated projectc. However, I really was focused in W3school tutorial to learn the basic function of Java since this time is first time for me to use Java. Especially, I focused on learning loop part.
